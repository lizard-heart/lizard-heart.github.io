[Bunch][https://bunchapp.co] is a Mac app that allows you to create plaintext files to launch a "bunch" of apps and change system settings. It is great for [contextual computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_awareness) and I use it to automatically rearrange windows with [hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org), set a Focus Mode with Shortcuts, open a perspective in [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/), and start a timer with [Timery][https://timeryapp.com] all at the same time when I switch contexts. The only problem is that it is a little bit annoying to edit these plaintext files without any syntax highlighting to see commands and strings and stuff like that.

To fix this, I created a plugin for my favorite text editor, [atom](https://atom.io) (I'm using it right now as I write this), which adds support for `.bunch` files. It also includes. snippets for common commands.

# [install the plugin here](https://atom.io/packages/language-bunch)
# [contribute to the plugin on github](https://github.com/lizard-heart/language-bunch)

## Creating atom language plugins
I created this plugin as a treesitter language plugin for atom. It has a very simple file structure:
{% highlight json%}
language-bunch
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── grammars
│   └── bunch.cson
├── snippets
│   └── bunch.cson
└── package.json
{% endhighlight %}

### Syntax highlighting
The `grammars/bunch.cson` file has a `patterns` field that lets you patch [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) patterns, and tell Atom what the text represents, a string, a variable, a command, etc. For example, here is the code to match comments in `.bunch` files.
{% highlight json%}
{
	name: 'comment.line.bunch'
	match: '#.*$'
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Snippets
Then, in the `snippets/bunch.cson` file, you can list a "prefix" and a "body" to show autocomplete suggestions for common commands. For example, here are a few commands I use for bunch files.
{% highlight json%}
'display':
	'prefix': 'di'
	'body': 'display '
'dark mode':
	'prefix': 'da'
	'body': 'dark mode'
'light mode':
	'prefix': 'li'
	'body': 'light mode'
'wallpaper':
	'prefix': 'wal'
	'body': 'wallpaper'
{% endhighlight %}
