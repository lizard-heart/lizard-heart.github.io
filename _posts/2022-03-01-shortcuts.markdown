I just added a Shortcuts page to this site where I will upload some Siri Shortcuts that I create. To start, there are [five shortcuts there already](https://lizard-heart.github.io/shortcuts/). The shortcuts are shared using [apple's icloud links for sharing shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/shortcuts/apdf01f8c054/) so you can click the links and use them yourself.
